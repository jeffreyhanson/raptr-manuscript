The classification contains different mixes of plant species within the canopy, shrub or ground layers, but are structurally similar and are often dominated by a single genus. In a mapping sense, the groups reflect the dominant vegetation occurring in a map unit where there are a mix of several vegetation types. Subdominant vegetation groups which may also be present in the map unit are not shown. For example, the dominant vegetation in an area may be mapped as dominated by eucalypt open forest, although it contains pockets of rainforest, shrubland and grassland vegetation as subdominants.","source":"http://www.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7Beade4b5f-6a30-46ae-86d8-58ed374ddc72%7D","enabled":true,"displayname":"NVIS 4.1 Major Vegetation Groups","pid":"","uid":"2125","metadatapath":"http://www.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7Beade4b5f-6a30-46ae-86d8-58ed374ddc72%7D","classification1":"Vegetation","classification2":"Classification","notes":"","source_link":"http://www.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/downloadData.page?uuid=%7Beade4b5f-6a30-46ae-86d8-58ed374ddc72%7D","licence_link":"http://www.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7Beade4b5f-6a30-46ae-86d8-58ed374ddc72%7D","licence_notes":"Separate State/Territory acknowledgement required on citation","maxlatitude":-8.13987,"minlatitude":-44.31837,"minlongitude":109.50436,"maxlongitude":157.21622,"displaypath":"http://spatial.ala.org.au/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=ALA:nvis41_mvg&format=image/png&styles=","scale":"","environmentalvaluemax":"","environmentalvaluemin":"","lookuptablepath":"","citation_date":"11/2012","datalang":"","licence_level":"2","mddatest":"","mdhrlv":"","respparty_role":"custodian","keywords":"dominant, tree, forest, woodland, canopy, understory","path_1km":"","domain":"Terrestrial","dt_added":1448542800000,"shape":true,"path_orig":"shape_diva/nvis41_mvg","environmentalvalueunits":"","name":"nvis41_mvg","id":2125,"type":"Contextual","path":"/data/ala/data/layers/ready/shape_diva"},{"description":"Occurrence Density","source":"ALA-SPATIAL","enabled":true,"displayname":"Occurrence Density","pid":"","uid":"898","metadatapath":"http://www.ala.org.au/","classification1":"Biodiversity","classification2":"","notes":"Occurrence Density is derived by applying a moving average to all point occurrences held by the Atlas of Living Australia.

It was developed from multiple forest, vegetation and land cover data inputs, including contributions from relevant Australian, state and territory government agencies and external sources.\r\n\r\nA forest is defined in this dataset as \"An area, incorporating all living and non-living components, that is dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding two metres and with existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata about equal to or greater than 20 per cent. This includes Australia's diverse native forests and plantations, regardless of age. It is also sufficiently broad to encompass areas of trees that are sometimes described as woodlands\".\r\n\r\nThe dataset was compiled by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) - a collaborative partnership between the Australian and state and territory governments - whose role is to collate, integrate and communicate information on Australia's forests. States and Territories agencies collect forest data using independent methods and at varying scales or resolutions. The NFI, through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), applies a national classification to state and territory data to allow seamless integration. Independent and multiple sources of external data are used to fill data gaps and improve the quality of the final dataset.\r\n\r\nForests of Australia (2013) v2.0 presents the new NFI classification with three national forest categories, as reported by the NFI in Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013 (SOFR 2013), and replaces the spatial dataset titled Forests of Australia (2013). The three national forest categories are: Native forest, Industrial plantations and Other forests. The 'Native forest' category has previously been reported by the NFI, however, 'Industrial plantations' and 'Other forests' are new categories for planted forests: 'Industrial plantations', for plantations managed commercially and reported through the National Plantation Inventory (NPI), and 'Other forest' for planted forest not managed commercially or otherwise not reported through the NPI.\r\n\r\nForests of Australia dataset series are produced to fulfil requirements of the Australia's National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and the Regional Forests Agreement (RFA) Act 2002. The dataset is used for domestic and international reporting.

Like plant and litter carbon stores, the soil carbon stores are strongly controlled by Net Primary Production (NPP), and hence by rainfall and saturation deficit. All these C stores are also modulated by temperature because low temperatures slow the decay of plant material and high temperatures promote rapid decay. Typically, most soil carbon occurs in the upper soil layer. Derived from the BiosEquil model by Raupach et al.

We therefore additionally compiled the 0.05Â°gridded pre-European (base) predictions of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous distributions which are outputs of the BiosEquil model by Raupach et al.

The 0.05Â° gridded data were resampled to 0.01Â° using the cubic algorithm with RESAMPLE in ARCINFO GRID.  Zero values were assumed to represent NODATA values (e.g. lakes) and were iteratively filled using the DATA option of the FOCALMEAN command with a CIRCLE expand radius of 3 cells in ARCINFO GRID, as described above.","source_link":"http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/Ecosystem-Sciences.aspx","licence_link":"","licence_notes":"Permission required to re-distribute derivative works.

The hindcast data represents the combined contribution to the bed shear stress by waves, tides, wind and density-driven circulation. The trimmed mean is simply the arithmetic mean calculated excluding a percentage of the highest and lowest values in the distribution. On this occasion the highest and lowest 25% of model observations were excluded for the calculation. The geometric mean was used alongside the trimmed mean to provide a more robust representation of the bulk of the values than the arithmetic mean would have provided (Hughes and Harris 2008).

In 2009 a number of new datasets were included in an updated version of the grid.\r\n\r\nThe 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia has been produced to include recently acquired datasets, and solutions to issues identified in the previous version. The revised grid has the same extents as its 2005 counterpart, including the Australian water column jurisdiction lying between 92 E and 172 E, and 8 S and 60 S. The waters adjacent to the continent of Australia and Tasmania are included, as are areas surrounding Macquarie Island, and the Australian Territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The area selected does not include Australias marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.\r\n\r\nThis report details the datasets and procedures used to produce the 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia. As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 decimal degree (dd) resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd NZ topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008).","source_link":"http://www.ga.gov.au/marine/bathymetry.jsp","licence_link":"https://www.ga.gov.au/gadds/licences/licence_1.html","licence_notes":"","maxlatitude":-8.00244,"minlatitude":-60.00244,"minlongitude":91.99762,"maxlongitude":171.99762,"displaypath":"http://spatial.ala.org.au/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=ALA:bath_topo_ausbath_09_v4&format=image/png&styles=","scale":"0.01 degree (~1km)","environmentalvaluemax":"3958","environmentalvaluemin":"-8764","lookuptablepath":"","citation_date":"2009","datalang":"eng","licence_level":"3","mddatest":"2010-01","mdhrlv":"","respparty_role":"custodian","keywords":"depth, dem","path_1km":"","domain":"Terrestrial,Marine","dt_added":1308837600000,"grid":true,"path_orig":"diva/bath_topo_ausbath_09_v4","environmentalvalueunits":"m","name":"bath_topo_ausbath_09_v4","id":848,"type":"Environmental","path":"/mnt/transfer/bath_topo_grid/dvd1/data/ESRI_Grid/ausbath_09_v4.tif"},{"description":"Bush Heritage Reserves as at 14/4/2015.

The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis 2015 version defines the Peel-Harvey NRM region. A boundary for the newly established OceanWatch Australia Limited NRM organisation has not been spatially defined. It has responsibility for enhancing fish habitats and improving water quality in estuaries and coastal marine environments. OceanWatch works with the fishing industry to continue the adoption of industry best harvesting practice and identify issues of common interest for fishers across Australia.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 version maintains the 2014 changes in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas. The 2012 version updated and formalised the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset. Whilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\r\n\r\nSince 2006, NRM regions have been important in the delivery of Australian Government funding initiatives including Caring for our Country, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Landcare Program, the Environmental Stewardship Program and the Working on Country Indigenous land and sea ranger program.\r\n\r\nIn total, this dataset represents 61 regions as set out below.

The dataset is designed to cover all Australian territory where Australian Government funded NRM projects might take place and includes major islands, external territories, and state and coastal waters in addition to the NRM regional boundaries. This 2014 version marks the change in NSW from Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) to Local Land Service areas which will now be used for NRM regions in NSW. The 2012 version updated and formalised the 2010 dataset (which was an interim update of the NRM Regions 2009 dataset, released Feb 2009). The original base layer version of this dataset was released in 2006 as the Natural Heritage Trust II (NHT2) Region Boundaries dataset.\r\n\r\nWhilst the boundaries of NRM Regions are defined by legislation in some states and territories this dataset should not be used to represent legal boundaries in any way. It is an administrative dataset developed for the purpose of reporting and public information. It should be noted that from time to time the states and/or territories may revise their regional boundaries in accordance with local needs and therefore alterations to either the attribution or boundaries of the data may occur in the future.\r\n\r\nSince 2006, NRM regions have been important in the delivery of Australian Government funding initiatives including Caring for our Country, the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Landcare Program, the Environmental Stewardship Program and the Working on Country Indigenous land and sea ranger program. \r\nIn total, this dataset represents 60 regions as set out below.

IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\r\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.","source_link":"http://www.environment.gov.au/metadataexplorer/explorer.jsp (search for 'IBRA' in \"Search title\" field)","licence_link":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en","licence_notes":"Data to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \r\nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en","maxlatitude":-9.14129,"minlatitude":-54.77699,"minlongitude":72.57738,"maxlongitude":167.99814,"displaypath":"http://spatial.ala.org.au/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=ALA:ibra7_subregions&format=image/png&styles=","licence_level":"3","keywords":"bioregion, ecoregion, system","domain":"Terrestrial","dt_added":1348495200000,"shape":true,"path_orig":"shape/ibra7_subregions","name":"ibra7_subregions","id":1049,"type":"Contextual","path":"/data/ala/data/layers/ready/shape"},{"description":"WOfS displays the detected surface water from the Australia-wide Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellite imagery archive.

IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions.\r\nVarious sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.","source_link":"http://www.environment.gov.au/metadataexplorer/explorer.jsp (search for 'IBRA' in \"Search title\" field)","licence_link":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en","licence_notes":"Data to be available in the Public Domain under Creative Commons by Attribution Licensing Agreement. \r\nMore information can be found here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/deed.en","maxlatitude":-9.14129,"minlatitude":-54.77699,"minlongitude":72.57738,"maxlongitude":167.99814,"displaypath":"http://spatial.ala.org.au/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=ALA:ibra7_regions&format=image/png&styles=","licence_level":"3","keywords":"bioregion, ecoregion, system","domain":"Terrestrial","dt_added":1348495200000,"shape":true,"path_orig":"shape/ibra7_regions","name":"ibra7_regions","id":1048,"type":"Contextual","path":"/data/ala/data/layers/ready/shape"},{"description":"Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) marine 2010","source":"DSEWPaC","enabled":true,"displayname":"Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) marine 2010","uid":"1051","metadatapath":"http://www.environment.gov.au/metadataexplorer/full_metadata.jsp?docId=%7B905AD083-39A0-41C6-B2F9-CBF5E0B86A3C%7D&loggedIn=false","classification1":"Area Management","classification2":"Biodiversity","notes":"The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) 2010 - Marine, provides both spatial and text information about off-shore protected areas in both state and commonwealth waters.
