Broad-scale environmental variation
===================================

This raster dataset contains broad-scale environmental data generated by running a principal components analysis (PCA) over bioclimatic variables. This dataset is used in the first case-study.

The original bioclimatic variables were [obtained online](http://www.worldclim.org/) and processing was performed in ArcMap (version 10.3).
